### Database & Schema Creation

Before loading data into the **Data Warehouse**, we first need to create the **database** and **schemas** to support the Medallion Architecture (**Bronze, Silver, Gold Layers**).

This script:
- Creates the **DataWarehouse** database.
- Defines **three schemas**: `bronze`, `silver`, and `gold` for data segregation.
