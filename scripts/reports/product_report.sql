Purpose:
    Consolidates product-related data into a detailed report for analytics and business decisions.

Features:
    1. Combines product metadata (name, category, subcategory, cost) with sales performance data.
    2. Segments products by total revenue:
        - High Performer: > 1,000,000
        - Mid Range: > 100,000
        - Low Performer: <= 100,000
    3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
        - Total orders
        - Total sales
        - Total quantity sold
        - Total unique customers
        - Lifespan (active months)
    4. Calculates KPIs for product performance:
        - Recency (months since last sale)
        - Average revenue per order
        - Average monthly revenue

Usage:
    Suitable for dashboards, performance tracking, and strategic planning.
