Script: Magnitude Analysis â€“ Distribution & Contribution Analysis
=========================================================================================================
Script Purpose:
      This script analyzes the distribution and magnitude of key metrics across customer 
      and product dimensions in the 'DataWarehouse' database.

      It answers questions like:
          - Where are most customers located?
          - What gender dominates the customer base?
          - Which product categories generate the most revenue?
          - Who are the top contributing customers?

Usage Example:
      -- Use this script to explore patterns in volume and value across countries, genders,
         product categories, and customer segments
