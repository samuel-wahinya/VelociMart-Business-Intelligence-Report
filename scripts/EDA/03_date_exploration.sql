Script: Date Exploration â€“ Identify Key Date Records
=========================================================================================================
Script Purpose:
      This script explores key date-related insights from dimension and fact tables in the 
      'DataWarehouse' database. It highlights earliest and latest values for:
          - Customer birthdates
          - Product start dates
          - Sales order dates

      This is useful for identifying historical range, detecting data issues, or performing timeline analysis.

Usage Example:
      -- Run this script to see the oldest and youngest customers, first and latest product sales,
         and the earliest and most recent orders placed
